Featuring a curated selection of works by Latin American artists, the exhibition celebrates the delicate encounters and serendipitous rituals that unfold at our fingertips while navigating the web."

By embracing the potential of technology to foster meaningful connections, the exhibition challenges us to reflect on how we can use technology to create a more interconnected and sustainable future."

Borges, 2015)."
